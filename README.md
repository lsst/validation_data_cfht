validation_data_cfht
====================

Raw data from CFHT and a Butler repository of the processed outputs to validate the performance of the LSST DM stack and provide reference comparisons for development.

Data are targeted at use by LSST DM Stack developers, continuous integration tests, and `validate_drp`.  General users who wish to simply see examples of the steps and products of the LSST DM Stack processing may likely also find this useful.

The use model for reprocessing these data for comparisons and continuous integration, is to use these data in as an input repository and then write to a separate output repository (by, e.g.,  specifying `--output` on the command line call to a Task).  One might then wish to compare the outputs of the two repositories at the image, catalog, or summary statistic or visualization plot level.

The "raw" data are not actually truly "raw", but rather post-ISR processing of the CFHT data by the Terapix(?) archive.

These data are provided as a Butler repository in its POSIX filesystem mode*.  This provides straightforward access through both the Butler mechanism for clean programatic use, but also relatively simple access directly from the file system for quick inspection and orientation to the data.

[*] Mode isn't quite the right word here.

Example usage
-------------

```
setup validation_data_cfht

NEW_OUTPUT_REPO=CFHT_data

export ASTROMETRY_NET_DATA_DIR=${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/astrometry_net_data

processCcd.py ${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/data \
    --output ${NEW_OUTPUT_REPO} \
    @${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/Cfht.list \
    -j 4
```

Notes:
 * There will be a `${NEW_OUTPUT_REPO}/_parent` link back to the input repository `${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/data`.
 * The list of images (`dataIds`) to process is in `@${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/Cfht.list`
 * `-j 4` specifies using 4 cores.  You may wish to change to an appropriate number on your system, but the intent is that `-j 4` should be a reasonable default in 2016.

Analyzing the repository
------------------------
One might then choose to use `validate_drp` to analyze the peformance of the results against SRD metrics.

```
setup validate_drp

validateDrp.py CFHT_data
```

Recreating the repository
-------------------------
This repository was created using `examples/runCfhtTest.sh` from the `validate_drp` package.

To fully recreate this Butler `repo` from the `raw` data, set the `mapper` and add the `ingesetImages.py` step:

```
setup validation_data_cfht -t 16.0

mkdir data
echo lsst.obs.cfht.MegacamMapper > data/_mapper
ingestImages.py data ${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/raw/*.fz   --mode copy
# Link in the reference catalogs
ln -s ${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/ref_cats data/ref_cats

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1  # Suppress OMP parallelism.  We parallelize by CCD.
processCcd.py data \
     --output data \
     @${VALIDATION_DATA_CFHT_DIR}/Cfht.list \
     -j 4 \
   >& processCcd.log
```

Notes
 1. We use `--copy` to create a full copy of the raw images in the repo.

The packages and versions used were recorded into `eups_setup_used.txt`:

```
eups list --setup | awk '{printf "%-30s %s\n", $1, $2}' > eups_setup_used.txt
```

and the repo was made read-only to prevent accidental writes to this repo.

```
chmod -R ugo-w data
```

 2. The reference catalogs get linked in to the new repo.  We want those to persist across different repos, but the current default expectation is that they will be linked to from with 'ref_cats' directory within the repository.

Git LFS
-------

To clone and use this repository, you'll need Git Large File Storage (LFS).
